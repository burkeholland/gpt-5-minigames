- index.html — launcher and instructions
- main.js — all game logic

Theme & concept:
A serene bioluminescent pond where you guide a glowing lotus and collect motes to grow and score points. Dark ripples periodically appear and shrink you — survive and collect as many motes as you can.

How to run:
Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox). No server required.

Assets (royalty-free sources):
- Background ambient: local file `main track.mp3` included in this folder (used as the backing track)
- Collect SFX: https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/459682/
- Hurt SFX: https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/403032/

Notes:
- All code is in `main.js` for easy editing. The game uses Phaser 3 via CDN. If audio fails to load due to CORS, the background track is already local in `main track.mp3` so audio should work offline.

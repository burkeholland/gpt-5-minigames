Aurora Bloom
=============

A small, local Phaser 3 game designed to be opened by launching `index.html` in a browser.

Files:
- index.html — Game launcher and brief instructions.
- main.js — All game logic (Phaser 3). Uses runtime-generated art and a background music URL.

Assets / Audio:
- Background music (royalty-free): https://pixabay.com/music/sounds/ambient-meditation-11095/
  - Direct mp3 used in code: https://cdn.pixabay.com/download/audio/2022/03/15/audio_1f7c4e6f0f.mp3?filename=ambient-meditation-11095.mp3

How to play:
- Controls: Left / Right arrow keys or A / D to move the glowing seed. On touch, tap and drag horizontally.
- Objective: Collect blooms (pink/blue glows) to earn points. Avoid dark shards — hitting one ends the run.
- Press Space to restart after Game Over.

Notes:
- The game uses Phaser 3 via CDN in `index.html`. Simply open `index.html` in Chrome/Edge/Firefox. If audio doesn't start automatically, click/tap the screen to allow playback.
